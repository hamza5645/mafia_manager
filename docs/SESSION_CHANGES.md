# Session Changes

## What Changed

- Reorganized the app entry point into `App/mafia_managerApp.swift`.
- Reworked `Core/` into domain folders:
  - `Core/Auth/`
  - `Core/Backend/`
  - `Core/Gameplay/`
  - `Core/Multiplayer/`
  - `Core/Stats/`
  - `Core/Support/`
- Split multiplayer views into clearer flow buckets:
  - `Features/Multiplayer/Entry/`
  - `Features/Multiplayer/Flow/`
- Moved the non-project `SupabaseConfig.swift.template` into `Core/Backend/`.
- Updated `AGENTS.md`, `docs/CLAUDE_PRIMER.md`, and `docs/ARCHITECTURE_NOTES.md` to match the new paths.

## Why

- The previous layout mixed technical buckets (`Models`, `Services`, `Store`) with feature-specific code, which made multiplayer/auth/stats ownership harder to follow.
- Several Xcode navigator entries were effectively stale or duplicated after earlier iterations. Moving files through Xcode-safe project operations normalized the navigator and kept the project buildable.
- Multiplayer screens were all flat in one folder; splitting entry vs in-game flow makes future changes less error-prone.

## Validation

- Rebuilt the project through Xcode after the moves.
- Result: successful build with the reorganized structure.

## Rollback

- To revert the structure, move files back to their previous paths using Xcode project moves, not raw `.pbxproj` edits.
- If you want a full rollback with Git, revert this changeset rather than manually dragging files around in Finder.
- If a future move affects target membership or file references, validate with an Xcode build immediately after the move batch.

## Known Gotchas

- This project’s Xcode navigator had path drift before the cleanup. Use Xcode-aware moves for source files so the project file stays consistent.
- The repo still contains a duplicate on-disk `mafia_manager/Assets.xcassets` folder that was not touched in this session because the active target is already building successfully and that asset cleanup should be done as a separate verification pass.
